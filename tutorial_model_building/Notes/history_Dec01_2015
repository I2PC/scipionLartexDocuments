# create LAdV-2 VIII homology model by forcing template use of Hong's VIII Ad5 structure

# LAdV2 sequence in Uniprot is A0A076FT36_9ADEN
# Ad5 PDB ID is 3iyn, VIII (peripentonal) is chain O
chimera
Fetch by id, pdb, 3iyn
Select, Chain, O

In Sequence window:
	Edit > Add sequence > give Uniprot code A0A076FYV2_9ADEN
	Edit > Realign sequences

	# may take a longish time, see progress in message region in the main chimera window bottom left corner
	
# Cterminal regions are just looooong loops. Hide them.

# Save session VIII_MODELLER.py

# the model closest to the template seems to be #3
# mostly only the head domain is reasonably modeled, the rest is garbage

# save pdb, selected atoms only, VIII_MODELLER.pdb, relative to 3iyn_A
