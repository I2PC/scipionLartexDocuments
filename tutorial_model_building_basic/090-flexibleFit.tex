\section{Refinement: Flexible fitting}
\label{refinementFlexibleFitting}
Although the rigid fitting approximates \iii{map} and atomic \iii{model}, a detailed visual inspection of \iii{map} and \iii{model} reveals that some residues are not perfectly fitted. In order to get a better fit, not only of the carbon skeleton but also of residue side chains, a flexible fitting or refinement has to be accomplished. Refinement can thus be defined as the optimization process of fitting \iii{model} parameters to experimental data. Different strategies, categorized as refinement in the real space and refinement in the Fourier space, can be followed. Implemented in \scipion are two protocols for real space refinement, \scommand{ccp4 - coot refinement} (Appendix \ref{app:ccp4CootRefinement}, \citep{emsley2010}) and \scommand{phenix - real space refine} (Appendix \ref{app:realSpaceRefineProtocol}, \citep{afonine2018a}, manual and automatic, respectively, and one automatic protocol to refine the \iii{model} in the reciprocal space, \scommand{ccp4 - refmac} (Appendix \ref{app:ccp4Refmac}, \citep{vagin2004}). 

Observe the new steps in the modeling \scipion workflow in \ffigure{fig:scipion_workflow_flexiblefit}.

 \subsection*{CCP4 \coot Refinement}
 
 Initially devoted to atomic models obtained by X-ray crystallography methods, \coot (from Crystallopgraphic Object-Oriented Toolkit) is a 3D computer graphics tool that allows simultaneous display of \iii{map} and fitted \iii{model} to accomplish mostly interactive modeling operations. Although this tutorial does not try to show every functionality of \coot, but indicate how to open, close and save partial and final \coot refined structures in \scipion, some of \coot basic relevant commands will be shown. Initially, we are going to refine our \iii{moldel} with \coot. First of all, open the \scommand{ccp4 - coot refinement} protocol (\ffigure{fig:coot_refinement_protocol} (1)), load the map asymmetric units (2), with electron density normalized to 1 (\coot performs this step by default), and the fitted structure $model$ (3). To read the protocol Help is recommended. After executing the protocol (4), the \coot graphics window will appear to start working. 
  
 \begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/Fig24}
  \caption{Filling in \coot refinement protocol.}
  \label{fig:coot_refinement_protocol}
  \end{figure}
  

  To check the objects downloaded in \coot, go to the second bar of the main menu and select \ttt{Display Manager}. Maps (numbers \ttt{\#2}, \ttt{\#3} and \ttt{\#4}) and model \ttt{Hgb\_alpha\_Atom\_struct\_\_3\_007124.cif} (number \ttt{\#0}) are displayed on the left (\ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis} (A)). Remark that you have bottoms to display a particular map (1) and to increase or reduce map density scrolling it (2). In this case, since we have selected the display of the unsharpened map asymmetric unit, we can only observe this \iii{map} together with the \iii{model}. If you want to check any of the sharpened maps, select it and scroll it. Note that all maps should be aligned. Try to see differences in details and connectivity of the map to assess if the sharpened maps really optimize the map density compared to the unsharpened one. If this is the case, try to follow the refinement according to the density of the best map (the most optimized one) checking the reliability of the density according to the unsharpened map, specially in the most controversial areas. Since you count on several sharpening maps you can also take advantage of the different map optimizations that you could have in the distinct areas of the map.\\  
  
  To start with the refinement process, we are going to identify the part of $model$ misfitted to the density map. Visual inspection would clarify this point in some cases, although direct observation of the \ttt{Density fit analysis} might be a shorter way. With this aim, go to the main menu of \coot graphical window and select \ttt{Validate -> Density fit analysis}. The density fit will be analyzed regarding a specific map. To select any of them, go to the \coot right side menu (\ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis} (B)(3)) and open the \ttt{Select Map for Fitting} window (C). This density analysis, that you can see for the three map asymmetric units in (\ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis} (D)) shows that residues 1, 51, 73, 138-142 do not fit perfectly to the density map. The color range scale goes from green color (good fit) to red color (bad fit). There are some differences among maps and, as it was expected, the sharpened maps display higher restraints and show additional residues partially misfitted.

  \label{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis}
  \end{figure}
  
  According to \ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis} (B), \ttt{MET} residue of the new chain \ttt{A} does not fit to the map density. Maybe this residue has been processed post-translationally, as we have anticipated in \textbf{Starting Input data} section. To solve this question, go to \coot main menu and select \ttt{Draw -> Go To Atom... -> Chain A -> A 1 MET} (\ffigure{fig:coot_go_to_atom} (A)). \ttt{MET} residue will be located in the center of \coot graphics window. Check if this residue is surrounded by any electron density. As \ffigure{fig:coot_go_to_atom} (B)(1) shows, no density associates to the first chain residue. \ttt{MET} will thus be deleted. Then go to the lower right side menu and select the symbol to delete items (B)(2). Select \ttt{Residue/Monomer} in the opened \ttt{Delete item} window, and click the \ttt{MET} residue that you want to delete. Go again to \ttt{Validate -> Density fit analysis} and check that the orange bar shown in \ttt{MET} residue \ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis} (B) has disappeared.

  \label{fig:coot_go_to_atom}
  \end{figure}
  
  Although in this particular example the most interesting manual refinement strategy could be repair only the misfitted residues because they are very few, in a more general case, in which we could have many misfitted residues, an initial quick refinement may be accomplished. With this purpose, first of all, go to the upper right side menu (\ffigure{fig:coot_go_to_atom} (B)(3)) and select all four restrictions for \ttt{Regularization and Refinement} in the respective window of parameters. Secondly, open the \scipion browser (\ffigure{fig:cootini} (1)) and navigate to the \ttt{extra} directory, open the \ttt{coot.ini} text file (2), and modify the file so it matches the information shown below (3).\\

 Finally, go back to \coot window and press ``U'' to initiate global variables and ``z'' to refine the next upstream 10 residues. Go through those residues, one by one, and accept refinement if you agree with it. If you disagree with the refinement of any residue, perform the interactive refinement, visualizing the residue side chain. Repeat the refinement process with ``z'' until the end of the molecule. Check that the red bar of residue number 53 (\ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis}) goes missing at the end of this process.\\
 
 After this partially automatic and partially interactive processing, go to \ttt{Draw -> Go To Atom... -> Chain A -> A 2 VAL} (\ttt{VAL} is now the first residue of the \ttt{metHgb} $\alpha$ subunit) and start the detailed interactive refinement of the initial residues of chain A. To accomplish this interactive refinement of a small group of 5 to 10 residues, select the blue circle in the upper right side menu and click the initial and final residues of the small group of residues (\ffigure{fig:coot_go_to_atom} (B)(4)). The group of selected residues gets flexible enough to look manually for another spatial distribution. Following these instructions, try to solve the misfit that you can find in \ttt{TYR} 141 residue at the end of the molecule. Specifically, try to improve the result of the \ttt{Validate -> Density fit analysis}, as you can see from (A) to (B) in \ffigure{fig:coot_density_fit_analysis2}, moving \ttt{TYR} 141 ((A)(1)) to the nearest empty map density ((A)(2)). Accept the refinement parameters after the displacement of \ttt{TYR} ((B)(3)). Finally, check the \ttt{Density Fit Graph}.

  \end{figure}
  
 Rotamer refinement is another refinement tool available in \coot. You can try to improve your current $model$ modifying rotamers reported as incorrect in \ttt{Validate -> Rotamer analysis}. Otherwise, the next refinement program in modeling workflow (\phenix \ttt{real space refine}) will perform rotamer refinement.\\
 
 At the end of this interactive refinement with \coot, the refined atomic structure has to be saved in \scipion. You can save the atomic structure with its default name/label by pressing \keys{w}. If you want to add a special label to identify the atomic structure in the \scipion workflow you can save that label in \coot main menu \ttt{Calculate -> Scripting -> Python} and the \ttt{Coot Python Scripting} window will be opened and you can write there your label name, for example \ttt{label1\_HBA\_HUMAN}. This label will appear in the \ttt{Summary} window of the \scipion framework (\ffigure{fig:coot_summary} (A)). Assuming that \ttt{0} is your \iii{model} number, write in Command:\\
 \\
 \ttt{scipion\_write (0, 'label1\_HBA\_HUMAN')}\keys{\return}\\

  \label{fig:coot_summary}
  \end{figure}
 
 In its interactive way, \scommand{ccp4 - coot refinement} protocol can be launched again whenever you want in \scipion, and the last atomic structure saved will be loaded in \coot graphics window. This functionality of \scipion allows to stop the interactive refinement and continue the process in the last refinement step, maintaining each one of the intermediate refined structures saved in order in the \scipion tutorial folder \ttt{/Runs/000XXX\_CootRefine/extra} (\ffigure{fig:coot_summary} (B)). Remark that if you want to continue with the refinement process you have to select the \ttt{Run mode} option \ttt{Continue} when you edit the \coot refinement protocol. In this way, to go again to intermediate refined structures is also possible. Finally, when you reach the final refined structure save it, and you may press \keys{e} to fully stop the \coot protocol.\\
 
 A similar refinement process to that followed in \coot for \ttt{metHgb} $\alpha$ subunit chain \ttt{A}, has to be carried out for the \ttt{metHgb} $\beta$ subunit.\\
 \\
 \ttt{Note for the refinement process of chains other than the first one}: Take into account the name of the chains. Check that the first chain has been called \ttt{A}. Since by default, every chain will be called \ttt{A} you have to change the name of all of them in this step, before saving in \scipion the atomic structure refined by \coot. Let's suppose that we are refining in \coot the \ttt{metHgb} $\beta$ subunit. To change the name of the chain go to the \coot main menu and select the option \ttt{Edit} (\ffigure{fig:chimerax_asymm_unit_2} (A)(1)) and then \ttt{Change chain IDs} and select the current name of the chain \ttt{A} (\ffigure{fig:chimerax_asymm_unit_2} (B)(2)) by the new one, \ttt{B} (3).

 \subsection*{\phenix Real Space Refine}
 
 In order to compare the previous \coot interactive refinement with an automatic refinement, we are going to use the
 \scommand{phenix - real space refine} protocol in parallel. This protocol implements in \scipion the \iii{phenix.real\_space\_refine} program developed to address cryo-EM structure-refinement requirements. Following a workflow similar to the \phenix reciprocal-space refinement program \iii{phenix.refine}, basically devoted to crystallography, \iii{phenix.real\_space\_refine} program, mainly used in cryo-EM, is able to refine in real space atomic models against maps, which are the experimental data.\\
 
 Start working by opening \scommand{phenix - real space refine} protocol (\ffigure{fig:phenix_real_space_refine_protocol} (1)), load as input volume the map asymmetric unit saved in \coot that you consider the most optimized one (2, the $deepEMhancer$ sharpened map in this case), write the volume resolution (3), and load the atomic structure ($model$ \ttt{new\_label\_HBA\_HUMAN}, (4)). After executing the protocol (6), results can be checked (7). Try to compare the \ttt{MolProbity statistics}
that you can see in the \ttt{Summary} of the \scipion framework after changing the \ttt{Advanced} parameter \ttt{Local grid search} (5) from \ttt{Yes} to \ttt{No} (default value). 

 \begin{figure}[H]

  \captionsetup{width=.9\linewidth} 
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/Fig29}
  \caption{Completing \phenix Real Space Refine protocol.}
  \label{fig:phenix_real_space_refine_protocol}
  \end{figure}
 
 The first tab of results shows the initial $model$ atomic structure  (\ffigure{fig:phenix_real_space_refine_chimera} (pink)) as well as the refined one (green), both fitted to the normalized map asymmetric unit saved in \coot. 
 
 \begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{\chimera visualization of refined $model$ of \ttt{metHgb} $\alpha$ subunit by \phenix Real Space Refine protocol.}
  \label{fig:phenix_real_space_refine_chimera}
  \end{figure}
  
  The rest of tabs detail different statistics useful to compare the quality of distinct $models$ such as $MolProbity$ statistics and \ttt{Real-space} correlations. $MolProbity$ results will be discussed in the next section of validation and comparison. Regarding \ttt{Real-space} correlations, different $models$ can be compared by using the global number of \ccmask, that indicates the correlation $model$-to-$map$ calculated considering the map region masked around the $model$. You can check also individual correlation values for each residue.  Remark that residues with lower correlation values might be susceptible to improve by additional refinement in \coot. Have a look to those correlation values and answer the following questions: (Answers in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_1}) \\
  
  \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
  \begin{framed}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What is the \ccmask value?
  \item Which one is the residue that shows the lower correlation value? Why?
  \item What is that correlation value?
  \item Which one is the second residue that shows the lower correlation value? Why?
  \item What is that correlation value?
  \item What is the correlation value of \ttt{HEME} group?
  \end{itemize}
  \end{framed}
  \end{minipage}\\
  
  The conclusion of this part of refinement in real space is that \coot and \phenix \ttt{real space refine} might perform complementary tasks. The usage of both protocols may improve the result, especially when partial processing or big arrangements of molecules are involved. Now, to take advantage of $model$ improvements performed with \coot, run \phenix \ttt{real space refine} after \coot. When you finish, check again the above values of correlation. Have they changed? (Answer in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_2})\\
  
  Before finishing our refinement workflow with \refmac, we can ask ourselves how can we improve correlations in real space by modifying the \ttt{Advanced} parameters in the protocol form. Will the correlation values change if we set to ``yes'' optimization parameters previously set to ``no'', and increase the number of macro cycles from 5 to 30? Take into account that this process takes much more time (around 6 times more) than the previous one. (Answer in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_3})\\
  
  \ttt{Note}: An interesting application of the \phenix \ttt{real space refine} visualization tools is the possibility of load \coot from the \phenix viewer and correct the structure of outliers residues and classhes. A recurively use of \phenix \ttt{real space refine} and \coot protocols is thus possible.
  
  \subsection*{\ccp4  \refmac}
  
  As in the case of \coot, \refmac (from maximum-likelihood Refinement of Macromolecules) was initially developed to optimize models obtained by X-ray crystallography methods but, unlike \coot, automatically and in reciprocal space. The $models$ refined in the real space with \coot and \phenix \ttt{real space refine}, successively, will be used as input to perform a second refinement step in the Fourier space with \refmac protocol \scommand{ccp4 - refmac}. Firstly, open the \refmac protocol form (\ffigure{fig:refmac_protocol} (1)), load the volume generated by \coot (2), the atomic structure obtained with \phenix \ttt{real space refine} (3), and the volume resolution as maximum resolution (4). Execute the protocol (5) and when it finishes, analyze the results (6).

  Clicking the first item in the display menu of results (\ffigure{fig:refmac_display_results} (1)), \chimera graphics window will be opened showing the input volume, the initial $model$ (\ttt{new\_label\_HBA\_HUMAN} obtained with \coot (\ffigure{fig:refmac_chimera}, pink), and the final \refmac refined $model$ (\ffigure{fig:refmac_chimera}, green). By clicking the third item in the display menu of results (\ffigure{fig:refmac_display_results} (2)), a summary of \refmac results are shown. Check if values of \ttt{R factor} and \ttt{Rms BondLength} have improved with this refinement process in these three cases:
  
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Running \refmac after \phenix \ttt{real space refine}:\\
   Why the improvement seems to be very small? (Answers in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_4})\\
   \item Running \refmac after \coot:\\
   Would you have seen a higher improvement running \refmac immediately after \coot, thus ignoring $model$ improvements generated by \phenix \ttt{real space refine}? (Answers in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_5})\\
   \item Running \refmac after \coot and after \phenix \ttt{real space refine} using a mask:\\
   Compare \refmac results (after \coot and \phenix \ttt{real space refine}) with those obtained selecting the option \ttt{No} in the protocol form parameter \ttt{Generate masked volume}. Use two different volumes, the one generated by \coot protocol, and the one generated by the \ttt{extract asymmetric unit} protocol. Are there any differences? Why? (Answers in appendix \ref{app:solutions}; \textbf{Question \ref{refinementFlexibleFitting}\_6})\\
