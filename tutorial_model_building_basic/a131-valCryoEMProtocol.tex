\section{Phenix Validation CryoEM protocol}
\label{app:valCryoEMProtocol}%a131

Protocol designed to validate through multiple tools the geometry of an atomic structure and the correlation with a model-derived map in \scipion by using \iii{phenix.validation\_cryoem} program \citep{afonine2018b}. Integrated in the $Phenix$ software suite (versions higher than 1.13; \url{https://www.phenix-online.org/}), \iii{phenix.validation\_cryoem} tool can be applied to assess cryo-EM-derived models in real space. This program computes \ttt{Real Space Correlation} coefficients between map and model-derived map and, additionally, it assesses the geometry and dihedral-angle combinations of atomic structures with the aim of following the improvement of models along the refinement process. Validation $MolProbity$ scores are shown at the end of the evaluation process.

     \label{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_2}
    \end{figure}
    
Five taps are shown in the upper part of the results window:
   \begin{itemize}
     \item \ttt{Volume and models}: \chimera graphics window will be opened by default. Atomic structure and volume are referred to the origin of coordinates in \chimera. To show the relative position of atomic structure and electron density volume, the three coordinate axes are represented; X axis (red), Y axis (yellow), and Z axis (blue) (\ffigure{fig:app_protocol_volume_3}).
     \item \ttt{Summary}: Three different summary tables are shown to describe the results obtained from \ttt{Model, Data} and \ttt{Model vs. Data} (\ffigure{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_3}). Concerning the atomic \ttt{Model}, numeric data from chains, residues, atoms and geometry are described, as well as main \molprobity statistics. \ttt{Data} summarizes experimental map box dimensions and different values of resolution computed with or without a mask. \ttt{Model vs. Data}\ details main real-space correlation coefficients.

         \label{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_3}
        \end{figure}
     \item \ttt{MolProbity}: Statistics concerning the atomic model, most of them obtained from \molprobity (\ffigure{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_4}).
        \begin{figure}[H]
         \centering 
         \captionsetup{width=.9\linewidth}

         \label{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_4}
        \end{figure}
        
        \begin{itemize}
         \item \ttt{Clashes: All-atom contact analysis}: List that contains all severe clashes (non-H atoms overlaping more than 0.4 \AA) found by PROBE. All these clashes can be visualized and solved graphically in \coot. If no hydrogens were present, REDUCE adds them before running PROBE. The list can be saved in a folder selected by the user.
         \item \ttt{CaBLAM: C-Alpha Based Low-resolution Annotation Method}: Method designed to assess the mainchain geometry of the atomic model by using protein C\textsubscript{$\alpha$}\xspace geometry and to identify areas of probable secondary structure. Residues that fall outside contours of expected protein behaviour based on high-quality datasets are considered outliers.
         \item \ttt{C-beta deviation analysis}: C\textsubscript{$\beta$}\xspace outliers deviate from ideal positions by more than 0.25\AA. Ideal C\textsubscript{$\beta$}\xspace position is determined from the average of the ideal C-N-CA-CB and N-C-CA-CB dihedrals. This measure is more sensitive than individual measures to both sidechain and mainchain misfittings. Its deviation is an indicator of incompatibility between sidechain and backbone. 
         \item \ttt{Cis and twisted peptides}: Residues showing $cis$ or $twisted$ conformations that could be modeling errors. $cis$ conformations are observed in about 5\% of Prolines and 0.03\% of general residues. Twisted peptides are almost certainly modeling errors.
         \item \ttt{Rotamers}: Rotamer outlier list contains residues that adopt an unusual conformation of $\chi$ dihedral angles. These outliers, commonly used to characterize the conformation of protein sidechains, are detailed in Chi1-Chi2 graph, shown below.
         \item \ttt{Rhamachandran}: Rhamachandran outlier list contains residues that show an unusual combination of their $\phi$ (C-N-CA-C) and $\psi$ (N-CA-C-N) dihedral angles. Most of the time, Ramachandran outliers are a consequence of mistakes during the data processing. These outliers are detailed below in Rhamachandran graphs.
         \item \ttt{Geometry Restraints}: Statistics for geometry restraints used in refinement. Although in general a fully refined structure should not have any outliers, exceptionally there are some of them that are obvious in high resolution electron density maps. Types of restraints:
            \begin{itemize}
             \item \ttt{Bond Length}: This table indicates the number of outliers and the number of restraints (in accordance with the bond length restraints library). The list of outliers details the bonded pairs of atoms sorted by deviation (higher than 4 sigmas).
             \item \ttt{Bond Angle}: This table indicates the number of outliers and the number of restraints (in accordance with the bond angle restraints library). The list of outliers details the bonded triplets of atoms sorted by deviation (higher than 4 sigmas). 
             \item \ttt{Dihedral Angle}: This table indicates the number of outliers and the number of restraints (in accordance with the side chain dihedral torsion - chi- angle restraints library). The list of outliers details the bonded tetrads of atoms sorted by deviation (higher than 4 sigmas).
             \item \ttt{Chilarity}: This table indicates the number of restraints (in accordance with the volume chilarity restraints library).
             \item \ttt{Planarity}: This table indicates the number of restraints (in accordance with the volume planarity restraints library).
             \item \ttt{Parallelity}: This table indicates the number of restraints (in accordance with the volume parallelity restraints library).
             \item \ttt{Non-bonded distance}: This table indicates the number of restraints (in accordance with the volume non-bonded distance restraints library).
            \end{itemize}
         \item \ttt{Display of rotamer and Rhamachandran outliers and clashes}: Interactive visualization of outliers (Ramachandran, rotamer and C\textsubscript{$\beta$}\xspace) and severe clashes with \coot.
        \end{itemize}
      \item \ttt{Model vs. Data}: Real-space correlation coefficients between map and model-derived map (\ffigure{fig:validationCryoEM_protocol_5}).

        \begin{itemize}
         \item \ttt{Overall correlation coefficients} \citep{afonine2018b}: 
         \begin{itemize}  
          \item \ttt{Mask CC}: Correlation coefficient between the model-derived map and the experimental map inside the mask region built around the model with a fixed radius. This comparison aims to fit the atomic centers.
          \item \ttt{Box CC}: Correlation coefficient between the model-derived map and the whole experimental map. This comparison aims to assess the similarity of maps and remark map densities that have not been modeled.
          \item \ttt{Volume CC}: Correlation coefficient between the model-derived map and the experimental map inside the mask region built around the model considering only model-derived map regions with the highest density values, ignoring regions below a certain contouring density threshold. Particularly, in this case the N points with the highest density, inside the molecular mask, are taken into account. This comparison aims to fit the molecular envelope defined by the model-derived map.
          \item \ttt{Peak CC}: Correlation coefficient between the model-derived map and the experimental map that considers only map regions with the highest density values, ignoring regions below a certain contouring density threshold. Particularly, in this case the N points with the highest density, simultaneously present in the model-calculated map and in the experimental map, are taken into account. This comparison aims to fit the strongest peaks in model-derived and experimental maps.
          \item \ttt{Main chain CC}
