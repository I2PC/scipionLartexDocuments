\section{How to solve some problems that you can find during the execution of the modeling workflow}
\label{problems}

\begin{itemize}
 
 \item \chimera command lines involving \scipion communication (\ttt{scipionwrite}, \ttt{scipionss}, \ttt{scipionrs} and \ttt{scipioncombine}) do not work:\\
 As indicated in \url{https://github.com/scipion-em/scipion-em-chimera/blob/devel/FAQ.rst}, these commands are \chimera plugins installed by the scipion-em-chimera setup. Firstly, check the right installation of the plugin just opening \chimera and executing the command line:\\ 
 \\ 
 \ttt{help scipionwrite}\\ 
 \\If it is installed, a help page will appear. Otherwise, type in the command line:\\
 \\ 
 \ttt{devel install /path\_to\_scipion3\_plugins/scipion-em-chimera/chimera/Bundles/scipion}\\ 
 \\
 where path\_to\_scipion3\_plugins is the path to the directory that contains Scipion3 plugins.\\
 Close the \chimera GUI and start the protocol again.

 \item \ttt{Maxit} installation
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Remember: \ttt{Maxit} requires \ttt{flex} and \ttt{bison}. Install them with sudo apt-get
        %\item 
        \end{itemize}

 
\end{itemize}
